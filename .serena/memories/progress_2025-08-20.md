# Progress — 2025-08-20 (LLM path planned)

## New tasks and issues
- Added task docs: 107 LLM Integration & Prompting, 108 Scholarly & RAG, 109 Evaluation & Observability (under /task).
- Created issues #70–#79 to track provider, prompts, Mastra LLM steps, flags, scholarly clients, RAG basics, eval harness, telemetry, and safety.
- Opened PR #80 to add the above task docs.

## Rationale and path
- Replace mocks with real LLM calls via a provider abstraction; start with REST (OpenAI/Google) to avoid SDK friction.
- Establish prompt library and zod schemas for candidate/plan outputs; add fallback parsing.
- Optionally enrich with RAG and scholarly results; propagate citations to export.
- Add evaluation + telemetry loops to quickly tune prompts and parameters.

## Next
- Implement provider abstraction and prompt library (issues #70, #71) → PRs.
- Swap Mastra steps to use LLM with schema validation (issues #72, #73) behind USE_REAL_LLM.
- Proceed to scholarly/RAG if time allows, else defer to after MVP.
