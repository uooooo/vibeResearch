# Progress — 2025-08-20

## Summary
- Theme Exploration (EPIC-100): End-to-end working — SSE start → candidates → suspend → resume to draft plan; UI for comparison. Results/runs persisted with basic RLS alignment.
- Research Plan (EPIC-101): Basic Plan page exists with save + history + restore + export endpoint. Mastra workflow hook supports resume; draftPlan fallback present.
- Supabase/Auth (EPIC-103): Client/server helpers, session provider, project CRUD, RLS notes implemented.
- UI Foundation (EPIC-104): Next 15 + Tailwind v4 layout/nav/theme toggle; shadcn/ui bootstrap pending.
- Deployment/Observability/RAG (EPIC-105/106/102): Not started or planned.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed TS build issues in `theme` page (runId narrowing) and Supabase route cookies sync usage.
- Verified build with Bun + Next 15.

## Open Items
- EPIC-101: Plan Editor UI improvements (section editing UX, per-section regenerate), Mastra ResearchPlanWorkflow skeleton, export template polish.
- EPIC-104: Introduce shadcn/ui primitives used across pages.
- EPIC-106: Runs/logs view for observability.
- EPIC-102: Minimal RAG pipeline (ingest/chunk/embed/search) scaffolding.
- EPIC-105: Vercel project setup and env wiring.

## Next Actions (Proposed)
1) Start EPIC-101 by adding per-section "Regenerate" (stubbed) via `POST /api/plans/regenerate` that persists a new draft version.
2) Add shadcn/ui base components (Button, Input, Textarea, Card) and replace ad-hoc classes.
3) Wire a simple Runs/Logs page to visualize `runs` and `results`.
4) RAG scaffolding under `src/lib/rag/` with placeholder functions and types.
