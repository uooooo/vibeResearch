# Progress — 2025-08-20

## Summary
- Repo aligned with AGENTS.md. Frontend scaffold (Next 15 + Tailwind v4) and APIs for runs/start|resume, plans(history|restore), export in place.
- Fixed TS types: runId narrowing in `/theme`, Supabase cookies sync in server-route.
- Branch: `feature/epic-101-plan-editor-improvements` checked out.
- Preparing EPIC-101 initial enhancement: add section-level Regenerate API + UI hook (stub now, LLM later).

## Evidence
- Commits: see 8a9cf99 and prior `feat(epic-101)` series.
- Tasks: `task/000` In Progress; 001–004 Done; Epic 100/103/104 partially progressed; 101/102/105/106 open.

## Next Actions
1) Add `POST /api/plans/regenerate` (rate-limited, auth, stub).
2) Wire Plan page buttons per section to call regenerate; save as new plan version.
3) Update acceptance checks: section-level regenerate + version restore + export.
4) Push branch and open PR; proceed with diff modal & citations pass.

## Risks/Notes
- Lockfile warning from parent `package-lock.json` when building `frontend/`.
- LLM/API keys not wired yet; stub regeneration returns deterministic "(revised)" suffix.
