# Progress â€” 2025-08-21 (Deep plan + issues)

## Updates
- Expanded epics with actionable breakdowns: 107, 108, 109.
- Added issue command set: task/ISSUES-2025-08-21-llm.md (gh CLI ready).

## Notes
- AI SDK implementation is green-lit; plan includes both @vercel/ai wiring (preferred for streaming) and REST fallback.
- Will consult Mastra and Vercel AI SDK docs via Context7 MCP during implementation.

## Next
- Confirm whether to actually create GitHub issues via `gh` now.
- If yes, run blocks in task/ISSUES-2025-08-21-llm.md and assign owners.
- Then begin with 107-1/107-2 (provider + AI SDK wiring).
